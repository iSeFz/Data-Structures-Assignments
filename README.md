# Assignment #3 Data Structures

A collaboration to complete the third assignment in the **Data Structures** Course at FCAI-CU.\
Here we will cooperate and help each others in order to finish all required tasks.

## Description & Tasks

### Application Description

The assignment requires developing an application that manages students where each student has an id, a name, department and a gpa.
Student data is stored in binary search tree (BST), self-balancing binary search tree (AVL), min and max heap.

> Any operation in one tree doesnâ€™t affect other trees.

### The application is divided into four main functions:

1. Add a new student
2. Remove a student using ID
3. Search for student using ID
4. Print All Students [Sorted by ID]

### The above functions should be implemented using four data structures:

- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree (AVL)
- Min Heap
- Max Heap

> In case of BST and AVL the key of the tree is the **ID**, while in min or max heap the key is the **GPA**.

### All functions & data structures are implemented in `C++`
