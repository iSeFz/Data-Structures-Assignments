# Assignment #1 - Data Structures
A collaboration to complete the first assignment in the **Data Structures** Course at FCAI-CU.\
Here we will co-operate and help each others in order to finish all required tasks.

# Description & Tasks
Create a package (namespace) called `sortlib` that contains the following sorting algorithms:
- Insertion sort.
- Selection sort.
- Bubble sort.
- Shell sort.
- Count sort.
- Merge sort.
- Quick sort.

All the above algorithms should be implemented by `C++` using **templates**.
